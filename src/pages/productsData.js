        details: 'Developed as part of my Master’s thesis in Interaction Design at KTH, The Bodyssey Kit invites participants to tune in to their bodies by engaging all five senses. Five modular artifacts—Body, Ground, Scent, Sound, and Weight—use haptic cues, ambient soundscapes, olfactory triggers, grounding textures, and load-shifting mechanics to nudge attention away from screens and toward lived, embodied experience.  I ran two week-long workshops with 5 participants; post-session reflections showed a measurable increase in self-reported interoceptive awareness and reduced perceived screen fatigue.',

        details: 'Conceived during an eight-week studio at KTH by Yeji Lee, Jackie Hellsten, Emily Nilson and Rurik Högberg, Weekbox helps introverted students translate the abstract flow of time into something they can pick up and rearrange. Magnetic blocks—each representing one- or two-hour slots and colour-coded for work, study, socialising or guaranteed “me-time”—snap into a desk-top frame, letting users sense at a glance where their hours are going. Built around the time-boxing technique, the system encourages deliberate limits on tasks while a quick phone scan digitises the physical layout, syncing it to a companion app that supports privacy controls and low-friction co-scheduling. In pilot tests with twenty KTH students, eighty percent of whom identified as introverts, participants reported feeling “greater control” over their week and less stress when arranging group work.',
